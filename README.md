# Minimal Flask App

This is the repo to [this tutorial](http://blog.vomkonstant.in/2019/02/20/a-slightly-betteâ€¦inimal-flask-app/).

It additionally contains a suitable Procfile for deployment on Heroku.

Also, checkout the `bare` branch, if you want to use this as a starting point for a project. On this pranch I have omitted lines that were purely for the educational purposes of the tutorial.
